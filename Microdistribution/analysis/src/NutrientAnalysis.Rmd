## Introduction

Patterned distributions of individual plant species and species groups are likely to reflect patterns in environmental conditions and constraints imposed on plant survival, growth, and reproductive ability by abiotic and biotic factors, including physiological tolerance of levels of various environmental conditions (e.g., soil moisture, [Ca], wind speed), competition with other plants, and interactions with herbivores and pathogens. If variation in the abundance of focal species characterized by different growth forms or physiologies is correlated with environmental conditions, and not due merely to limited plant dispersal, it can suggest that those forms or physiologies are adapted to different states or levels of those conditions.

Sarracenia is a genus of 11 species of carnivorous plants, occurring on the coastal plains of the eastern United States, that produce pitcher-shaped leaves filled with liquid that function as pitfall traps. 

Givnish (personal communication) observed a patchy distribution of S. alata in the extensive wet, sandy pine savannas at Buttercup Flats near Wiggins, Mississippi in the DeSoto National Forest. Such wet pine savannas of the Gulf Coastal plain of the United States contain an extraordinary diversity and abundance of carnivorous plants occurring down slope from mesic longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) dominated uplands (Brewer, 1999). On these sites, S. alata tends to co-occur with crayfish mounds made of clay material (Givnish, pers. obs.), suggesting that the plantâ€™s locally patchy distribution may have originated from a hidden variability in the physical composition of the substrate (Brewer, 1999). Specifically, the presence of clay lenses in the subsoil may create localized anoxic zones that prevent nitrogen fixation by soil microbes, leading to wet, N-poor microsites that favor the establishment of carnivorous plants, due to low levels of soil nitrate and hostile, anoxic conditions that can work against root uptake of soil nutrients generally. I therefore aim to test the hypothesis that scattered but hidden clay lenses help generate the patchy distribution of Sarracenia, creating zones that are poor in nitrate and dissolved oxygen.

Thirteen transects crossing the described vegetation pattern were set up randomly within in the savanna at Buttercup Flats facing a compass bearing of 160 degrees. Each transect contained a pitcher-absent microsite in the middle and 10-m of pitcher-present microsites on each end. Transects 11, 12, and 13 intersected multiple pitcher-absent patches and were therefore evaluated at more locations compared to the other transects. Soil and tissue nutrients, ground Coverage of all species, and soil clay content clay content were measured at these sites using a stratified random design.

##Analysis of Soil Nutrients

Plant Root Simulators (PRS, available from [Western Ag](https://www.westernag.ca/)) with cation and anion exchange resins be planted in pairs of three in two locations along the transect: 1) a random location at the pitcher-present microsite in the beginning ten meters of the transect and 2) a random location in each pitcher-absent microsite contained within the transect. Probe burial time was 46-47 days. All soil nutrients were measured in $\mu$g/$cm^2$.

Each nutrient is be evaluated independently for its interaction with microsite type (pitcher plant-present, pitcher plant-absent). 

```{r include=FALSE}
setwd("/home/sparks/Desktop/Thesis_Projects/Microdistribution/analysis/cleaned/")
```

```{r}
  soilNPK <- read.csv(file = "/home/sparks/Desktop/Thesis_Projects/Microdistribution/analysis/cleaned/soilNPK.csv", header = TRUE)
```

### Soil Potassium

```{r}
hist(soilNPK$K, main="")
```
The histogran for soil potassium concentrations is slightly right-skewed.

Q-Q plots were used to test for normality because the Shapiro-Wilk test is not powerful at small sample size (n=31).

```{r}
qqnorm(soilNPK$K, main = '')
qqline(soilNPK$K)
```

Sample quantiles do not show noticible deviation from Q-Q plot does not suggest any significant deviations from normality. Three outliers can be seen in the Q-Q plots.

#### Nutrient-Microsite Interaction

At transects 11, 12, and 13, multiple data points (for soil nutrients only) were collected for pitcher plant-absent microsites. It is necessary to sum these pitcher plant-absent data points for their respective transects to ensure that the subsequent paired t-test is perfomed with equal sample sizes.

A new vector is created specifically for the paired t-test.
```{r}
K_PairedReady <- soilNPK$K[c(1:21,26,27)]
```

Data points for pitcher plant-absent microsites are summed for each transect.
```{r}
Kminus11 <- sum(soilNPK$K[22:25])
Kminus12 <- sum(soilNPK$K[27:28])
Kminus13 <- sum(soilNPK$K[30:31])
```

These summed values are appended to the vector at the correct index.
```{r}
K_PairedReady <- append(K_PairedReady, Kminus11, after = 21)
K_PairedReady <- append(K_PairedReady, Kminus12, after = 27)
K_PairedReady <- append(K_PairedReady, Kminus13, after = 29)
```

Soil Potassium measurements ate then separated into pitcher plant-present and pitcher plant-absent microsites.

```{r}
K_minus <- K_PairedReady[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
K_plus <- K_PairedReady[c(FALSE, TRUE)]
```

A paired t-test is performed on pitcher plant-absent and pitcher plant-present K soil concentrations.
```{r}
t.test(K_plus, K_minus, paired = TRUE)
```
K concentrations are not significantly different between pitcher-present and pitcher-absent microsites based on a critical value of 0.05.


A linear model is also constructed as both a supplement and a comparison to the paired t-test.

Transect number is explicitly stated to be a factor.
```{r}
as.factor(soilNPK$Transect)
str(soilNPK)
```

The linear model is constructed with K as the dependent variable, transect number as the first factor, and microsite as the second factor.
```{r}
fit <- lm(soilNPK$K ~ soilNPK$Transect + soilNPK$Microsite)
anova(fit)
plot(fit)
summary(fit)
```
Small F-statistic suggests low predictive power for model.

Variances appear to be homogeneous. Normal Q-Q plot does not show any significant deviation from normality. Two data points have high leverage.


A supplemental two way interaction plot between nutrient concentration and microsite type is constructed as a visual aid to the above tests.

```{r}
interaction.plot(soilNPK$Microsite, soilNPK$Transect, soilNPK$K, legend=FALSE)
```
The two-way interaction plot shows weak interactions between K and microsite.


#### Soil Nitrogren

Soil nitrogen is evaluated as both Total Nitrogen and its components:

Soil Total Nitrogen is the sum of soil nitrate (NO3) and soil ammonium (NH4).

```{r}
soilNPK$TN <- soilNPK$NO3 + soilNPK$NH4
```

###Analysis of Sedge tissue nutrients

Aboveground biomass of 6 species of sedges in the Rhynchospora genus (R. megalocarpa, R. compressa, R. gracilenta, R. plumosa, R. rariflora, R. harveyi var harveyi) were collected, dried, and analyzed for % N, P, and K content, as a measure of the availability of these nutrients to non-carnivorous plants. All species are C3.

All tissue nutrients were measured in % of Aboveground Dry Mass.

#### NPK Limitation Diagram

N:P, N:K, and P:K ratios from tissue nutrient measurements are compared to critical ratios put forth by Olde Venterink et al. (2003) to determine whether plants are P or P + N limited (N:P > 14.5, K:P >3.4), K or K + N limited (N:K > 3.1, K:P < 3.4), or N limited (N:P < 14.5, N:K < 2.1). The relationship between N:P:K ratios and type of nutrient limitation is illustrated in the subsequent triaxial graph.

```{r}
tissuenutrients <- read.table("/home/sparks/Desktop/Thesis_Projects/Microdistribution/analysis/cleaned/tissueNPK.csv", header = TRUE, sep=",")

library(ggtern)

plot <- ggtern(data = tissuenutrients, aes(x = TN, y = P, z = K)) +

geom_Tisoprop(data=N/P, value=0.2, color='darkgreen') +
  
geom_Risoprop(data=P/K, value=0.145, color='darkblue') +

geom_Lisoprop(data=N/K, value=0.4, color='darkred') +

geom_point(aes(fill = Microsite),

 
size = 6,

shape = 21,

color = "black") +

ggtitle("NPK limitation diagram") +

labs(fill = "Microsite") +

theme_rgbw() +

theme(legend.position = c(0,1),

legend.justification = c(1, 1))

plot
```

Critical ratios are represented by vertical lines.

Plants in both pitcher-present and pitcher-absent microsites are most strongly N-limited (?).
